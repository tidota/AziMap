# AziMap: Azimuthal projection

This is the original source code for the program published in [my old web site](https://sites.google.com/site/somedayuniverse/contents/azimuthal-projection) back to 2012.

It loads the plate carre image of the earth and projects it as an azimuthal map. The center of the map can be manipulated by the mouse.
The code is written in C++/CLI (for some reason).
